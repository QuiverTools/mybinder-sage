which comes with `QuiverTools <https://quiver.tools>`_ installed,
together with some easy examples.

Instructions to ourselves
=========================

With `jupytext` one can convert between `.py` and `.ipynb`.
In particular, the following

.. code-block::
   jupytext --to ipynb src/basic.py
   mv src/basic.ipynb notebooks

converts the very rudimentary proof of concept to a notebook.

I have left the result of `jupytext --to py start.ipynb`, which is the
example provided in the original repository, in the `/src` directory,
so that we know which syntax to use.
